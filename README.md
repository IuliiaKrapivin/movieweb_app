# Movie CRUD Web Application with API

## This project is a fully functional example of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application developed in Python. It integrates an API for searching movie information and stores data in a JSON file. The application serves as a learning tool to demonstrate the principles of web development, API integration, and basic data storage techniques.


This web application allows users to create their list of favorite movies. They can fetch movie information by 
typing a movie name in the search field. The movie will be added automatically with the following information 
(like director, year, rating). Users also can update this information manually or delete the record.  
The project was created using the following technologies:
* Python as a core programming language 
* Flask web framework for backend development 
* HTML and CSS for frontend design and styling
* API integration for movies data fetching  
* JSON format for data storage


## How to install 
1. Clone this project
2. Run the application by running app.py
